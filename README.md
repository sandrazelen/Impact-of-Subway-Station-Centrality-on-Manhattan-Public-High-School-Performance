## About

The New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority subway system is the largest transportation agency in North America, serving more than 3 million riders daily. In Manhattan, only 23.4\% of households own a car, making the borough highly dependent on the subway for transportation.
Understanding that robust transportation infrastructure greatly influences urban landscapes, our study explores the impact of the MTA on public high school performance throughout Manhattan. Previous research has studied how subway centrality shapes various socioeconomic outcomes, such as job mobility, racial inequities, and housing prices. However, there is a lack of literature on the relationship between subway centrality and education quality. This gap is worth exploring because education quality has been linked to long-term educational attainment and higher valuations of neighborhoods \cite{schoolSpatial}. A more holistic understanding of how subway infrastructure affects these outcomes can inform school choice, and possibly contribute to urban planning decisions like deciding locations for new schools or where to extend subway lines.
